The Kitchen Island Size that�s Best for Your Home Bob Vila From bobvila.com
I think putting the range/cooktop in the island makes sense, because we cook more than we clean, ha ha, and the cooking should take center stage. This can drastically change, depending on your needs and the size of the kitchen. A kitchen island isn’t only a functional cooking countertop, it’s a part of décor, a storage space, a seating area and it can fulfill almost any other function that you want. Finish the top with your choice of countertop.
